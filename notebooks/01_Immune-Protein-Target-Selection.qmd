## Project Goals

In this notebook we will explore ....--- data set to determine immune proteins of interest. At a high-level, we are searching for protein that may be targets for interaction with microbial components.

Proteins of interest will likely display some of the following traits:

-   Secretion, Surface Receptors

-   Modulation in immune cells upon activation

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
